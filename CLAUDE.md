# COMP4020 prototype

Your starter repo for a COMP4020 prototype: a static site in HTML/CSS/TypeScript
that builds to plain HTML/CSS/JS and deploys to GitHub Pages. The deployed site
is what gets marked, not this repo.

The
[course website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp4020-agentic-coding-studio/)
publishes this deliverable's brief and spec, and this repo's name tells you
which deliverable applies. Read both before you plan or build.

## How to work in here

- Keep the dev server running (`pnpm dev`) so you see changes as you make them.
- Run `pnpm check` before you push.
- Open the page in a browser and look at it. The rendered page is the truth;
  your mental model of it isn't.
- When a check fails, read its output before you change anything.
- Never commit a red state.

## The link-preview card

`public/card.png` (1200x630) is the image a shared link shows; `index.html`'s
head points at it. Replace it and the `description` meta, and copy the head
block into any new page. The card URL resolves against the page that names it,
like any link --- `./card.png` is wrong one directory down, and nothing in CI
checks it, so look at the deployed head when you add pages.

## The checks

`pnpm check` runs them (`pnpm check:evidence` is the extra gate before you
ship); CI runs the same plus links, secrets and the deploy. Read the failure.

`spec/README.md`, `PROCESS.md` and `reflections/README.md` are in this repo and
say what they are for.

## Things this stack keeps getting wrong

Carried forward from previous weeks --- general lessons about this template's
tooling, not tied to any one prototype's content:

- **stylelint's `selector-class-pattern` is kebab-case, so BEM `__`/`--` fails.**
  Rename classes to fit the rule; don't loosen the config to fit the names.
- `stylelint-config-standard` wants range syntax in media queries
  (`@media (width < 34rem)`, not `min-width`/`max-width`), modern colour
  notation with percentage alpha (`rgb(255 255 255 / 12%)`), and an empty line
  before every comment inside a block.
- **`alpha-value-notation` wants the opposite notation for a bare `opacity`:** a
  number (`opacity: 0.7`), not a percentage --- even though the same config
  demands `%` for the alpha channel *inside* a colour. `keyframe-selector-notation`
  wants `0%`/`100%` rather than `from`/`to` in any `@keyframes` block that also
  uses a percentage stop. Both are notation-only, so `pnpm exec stylelint --fix`
  is the right tool --- read the diff to confirm it changed nothing but notation.
- **axe reports contrast over a gradient as "incomplete", not "pass".** Don't
  read a low/zero violation count as real coverage; measure the rendered pixel
  directly when the background isn't flat.
- `agent-browser`'s `is visible` is an in-viewport check, not a
  `display`/`visibility` check --- a perfectly visible element below the fold
  reads as `false`. Assert on `getComputedStyle(...).display` via `eval`
  instead.
- `agent-browser batch` takes an array of *arg arrays* on stdin
  (`["set","viewport","1920","1080"]`, not `"set viewport 1920 1080"`), and
  there's no `--file` flag --- generate the JSON and pipe it.
- **Reusing a port serves the browser a stale page.** Append a
  `?v=<timestamp>` cache-buster to the URL, or a previous run on that port will
  happily confirm a version of the page you deleted.
- **`[].every()` is `true`, so a probe over an empty list is a false pass.**
  Any "all of them are fine" assertion has to assert a non-zero count first
  (`items.length > 0 && …`).
- **A CSS `transform` overrides an SVG `transform` attribute on the same
  element** --- it doesn't compose with it. Put a static transform on an outer
  `<g>` and animate a child inside it instead.
- **A flex `flex-basis` is a width in a row layout and a height once a media
  query stacks it into a column.** Reset it to `flex: 0 0 auto` in the stacked
  layout rather than letting the row value leak through.
- **A sticky bar above a `100svh` hero overflows the first screen by exactly
  the bar's height.** Hold the bar height in one custom property and use it
  both to shrink the hero (`calc(100svh - var(--nav-h))`) and to offset anchor
  targets (`scroll-margin-top`), so overriding it once at a breakpoint updates
  every use.
- **Measure the phone fold; don't reason about it.** Check where a control and
  the thing it changes actually land at 390x844 before redesigning around a
  problem that measuring might show doesn't exist.
- **`transform: scale(var(--x))` transitions fine with an *unregistered*
  custom property** --- the transition is declared on `transform`, and `var()`
  is substituted at computed-value time. `@property` is only needed to
  transition the custom property itself.
- **Gradients don't interpolate.** A transition can't animate
  `background-image`; crossfade stacked layers on `opacity` instead.
- **Position and size have to live on separate elements when scaling
  something.** `translate()` then `scale()` on one element means the *size*
  decides where it lands. Split into a positioning wrapper and a scaling
  child.
- **A dimension in `vw` with an offset in `vh` (or vice versa) needs a
  separate override per viewport shape** --- it can't be derived once and
  reused, because the two units don't track each other across aspect ratios.
- **`visibility: hidden` takes an element out of hit-testing**, so a harness
  that hides the page before capturing it can't also click a control hidden
  that way. Interact first, then hide, then capture --- and hash output files
  before trusting a sweep that looks suspiciously uniform.

## Working style

- **A re-theme is CSS-only, not a rewrite.** When asked to restyle or re-theme
  a page, change presentation (styles, and only the markup needed to carry new
  classes/structure) and leave existing body text --- paragraphs, headings,
  labels --- exactly as written. Don't rephrase prose to "fit" a new theme's
  voice, and don't add new decorative copy unless asked. If a style genuinely
  can't be expressed without a structural change, raise that as a separate
  call-out rather than folding a silent content edit into the restyle.

## This file is yours

A starting point, not a rulebook. As you learn what your prototype needs --- a
convention the work has to hold to, a sensor that keeps catching you out (a
linter, say), a fact about the stack that is easy to get wrong --- write it down
here and wire it into `check`. Growing this file is the work.
